# Knowledge Authoring Logic Machine for Factual Language (KALM<sup>FL</sup>)
Authors: Yuheng Wang, Giorgian Borca-Tasciuc, Nikhil Goel, Paul Fodor, Michael Kifer

The KALM<sup>FL</sup> system allows knowledge authoring with the aim of endowing domain experts with tools that would allow them to translate their knowledge into logic by means of Factual Language. KALM<sup>FL</sup> extends KALM (https://github.com/tiantiangao7/kalm) and its querying extension KALM-QA (https://github.com/tiantiangao7/kalm-qa) from the Controlled Natural Language supported by Attempto in the direction of general parsers.

# Installation and Configuration
1. Download BabelNet 3.7 indices. User must request access from http://babelnet.org/download. The license of BabelNet 3.7 indices applies.
2. Install XSB Prolog Version 3.8 (http://xsb.sourceforge.net/). The license of XSB Prolog is GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 2.0 (LGPLv2).
3. Add the the key of BabelFy to `config/babelnet.properties`.
4. Add the path to BabelNet 3.7 indices to `config/babelnet.var.properties`.
5. Add the path to XSB to `config/xsb.properties`

# Code
* `config/` KALM<sup>FL</sup> config files.
* `kalmfl/` The KALM<sup>FL</sup> system web app. Run `kalmfl/run.py` to start the application.
* `kalmfl/multistanza/` Python code for Multi-Stanza, modified from the Stanza repository https://github.com/stanfordnlp/stanza.
* `kalmfl/parser/` The core functional code for KALM<sup>FL</sup>, including syntactic parsing, error detection and correction, and frame-based parsing.
* `kalmfl/disambiguation/` Java code for role-filler disambuguation and ULR generation.

* `lib/` BabelNet lib files (used as external librabries).
* `resources/jlt/` and `resources/wnplusplus/` BabelNet resources files (please download from BabelNet website specified in requirement section).
* `resources/frameont/frame_ont.txt` The file containing the frame descriptions.
* `resources/semantic_score_meta/` Files containing the weight bias scores, edge penalty scores, and overriden semantic links.
* `testsuite/` Test suite including CNLD, CNLDM, MetaQA templates, NLD.

# How to add a new frame
1. open `resources/frameont/frame_ont.txt`
2. Add a new frame at the end of the line. e.g., 
	`fp('Growing_food',[property('Grower',['bn:00046516n']),property('Food',['bn:00035650n','bn:00035649n'])]).` 

# How to compose an annotated sentence and learn a new lvp
1. Open `kalmfl/parser/framebasedparsing/train/data/train_user_defined.pl`
2. Add a new annotated sentence. e.g., 
	`train('Mary has a job at IBM in London.','Being_employed','index(1,4)',[pair('Employee',index(1,1),required),pair('Employer',index(1,6),optional),pair('Place',index(1,8),optional)],[],'[Employee:required] has a job at [Employer] in [Place].').` 
3. Open `kalmfl/parser/framebasedparsing/train/data/train_user_defined.txt`
4. Add the sentence in plain text. e.g.,
	`Mary has a job at IBM in London.`
5. Run `python kalmfl/parser/framebasedparsing/train.py --mode train --ont user`

# How to start the web app
1. Command line: `python ./kalmfl/run.py`
2. Start from IDE and run `kalmfl/run.py`
